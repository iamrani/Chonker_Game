# Chonker_Game

Chonker's Escape is a computer game that is displayed on a VGA text mode screen. It is written in X86 assembly language and uses software interrupts to minimize the amount of programming needed. These interrupts are used to display the game elements (rocks and the chonker), detect keypresses, scroll the screen, and introduce a brief pause between each frame of the game. The MASM assembler can be used to assemble the code and create the final version of the game.
